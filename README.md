# Lunar Tear

Private server research project for a certain discontinued mobile game.
Discord server: https://discord.gg/MZAf5aVkJG

## How To Launch The Server

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.25+
- [goose](https://github.com/pressly/goose) migration tool
- Populated `server/assets/` directory

```bash
go install github.com/pressly/goose/v3/cmd/goose@latest
```

### Quick Start (Wizard)

The interactive wizard walks you through setup with a few simple questions — no flags or networking knowledge needed. It auto-detects the right IP address for your emulator or phone and launches all services.

```bash
cd server
go run ./cmd/wizard
```

Your choices are saved so next time you just press Enter to relaunch with the same settings.

#### Custom Ports

By default the wizard uses ports 8003 (gRPC), 8080 (CDN), and 3000 (auth). Override any of them with flags:

```bash
go run ./cmd/wizard --grpc-port 9003 --cdn-port 9080
```

| Flag          | Default | Description      |
| ------------- | ------- | ---------------- |
| `--grpc-port` | `8003`  | gRPC server port |
| `--cdn-port`  | `8080`  | CDN server port  |
| `--auth-port` | `3000`  | Auth server port |

Custom ports are saved to `.wizard.json` alongside your other settings. On the next run the saved ports are reused automatically — no need to pass the flags again. If you later pass different port flags, the wizard warns you that the ports changed and asks for confirmation before continuing.

### Regenerate protobuf stubs

```bash
cd server
make proto
```

### Database

Player state is stored in a SQLite database. Run migrations before starting the server:

```bash
cd server
make migrate
```

Or manually:

```bash
cd server
mkdir -p db
goose -dir migrations -allow-missing sqlite3 db/game.db up
```

### Importing a Snapshot

To import a JSON snapshot into the database, use the import tool. The `--uuid` flag must match the UUID your game client sends during authentication:

```bash
cd server
make import SNAPSHOT=snapshots/scene_1.json UUID=<your-client-uuid>
```

Or directly:

```bash
go run ./cmd/import-snapshot \
  --snapshot snapshots/scene_1.json \
  --uuid <your-client-uuid> \
  --db db/game.db
```

| Flag         | Default      | Description                                   |
| ------------ | ------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `--snapshot` | *(required)* | Path to JSON snapshot file                     |
| `--uuid`     | *(required)* | UUID to assign (must match the client's UUID)  |
| `--db`       | `db/game.db` | SQLite database path                           |

### Run

The server is split into two binaries: a gRPC game server and an HTTP asset CDN. Both must be running for the client to work.

**Start the CDN** (serves asset bundles, list.bin, master data, web pages):

```bash
cd server
go run ./cmd/octo-cdn \
  --listen 0.0.0.0:8080 \
  --public-addr 10.0.2.2:8080
```

**Start the game server** (gRPC, points the client at the CDN):

```bash
cd server
go run ./cmd/lunar-tear \
  --listen 0.0.0.0:8003 \
  --public-addr 10.0.2.2:8003 \
  --octo-url http://10.0.2.2:8080
```

The default listen address is `0.0.0.0:443`, which requires `sudo` (privileged port). Use `--listen` with a high port to avoid this. If you do need port 443, either use `sudo` or grant the binary the capability on Linux:

```bash
go build -o lunar-tear ./cmd/lunar-tear
sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep ./lunar-tear
./lunar-tear --public-addr 10.0.2.2:443 --octo-url http://10.0.2.2:8080
```

The CDN can run on a completely separate machine — just set `--octo-url` on the game server and `--public-addr` on the CDN to the externally-reachable address.

### Run All Services At Once

Instead of starting each service individually, use the dev runner to launch all three (auth, CDN, game server) with a single command. No Docker required — works on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

```bash
cd server
make dev
```

Or directly:

```bash
cd server
go run ./cmd/dev
```

Each service's output is prefixed with a colored label (`[auth]`, `[cdn]`, `[grpc]`). Press Ctrl+C to shut everything down.

The dev runner automatically builds each service into `bin/` before launching. This means the binaries have stable file paths, so **Windows Firewall only prompts once** — subsequent runs reuse the same allowed executables. The wizard performs the same build step transparently.

Override defaults with namespaced flags:

```bash
go run ./cmd/dev --grpc.listen 0.0.0.0:9000 --grpc.public-addr 10.0.2.2:9000 --cdn.public-addr 192.168.1.50:8080
```

Or via `make`:

```bash
make dev ARGS="--grpc.listen 0.0.0.0:9000 --grpc.public-addr 10.0.2.2:9000"
```

| Flag                  | Default            | Description                              |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `--auth.listen`       | `0.0.0.0:3000`     | auth-server listen address               |
| `--auth.db`           | `db/auth.db`       | auth-server SQLite database path         |
| `--cdn.listen`        | `0.0.0.0:8080`     | octo-cdn local bind address              |
| `--cdn.public-addr`   | `10.0.2.2:8080`    | octo-cdn externally-reachable addr       |
| `--grpc.listen`       | `0.0.0.0:8003`     | lunar-tear gRPC listen address           |
| `--grpc.public-addr`  | `10.0.2.2:8003`    | lunar-tear externally-reachable addr     |
| `--grpc.octo-url`     | `http://10.0.2.2:8080` | Octo CDN base URL passed to lunar-tear |
| `--grpc.auth-url`     | `http://localhost:3000` | auth server base URL passed to lunar-tear |
| `--no-color`          | `false`            | disable colored output                   |

### Game Server Flags (`lunar-tear`)

| Flag            | Default           | Description                                          |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `--listen`      | `0.0.0.0:443`     | gRPC listen address (host:port)                      |
| `--public-addr` | `127.0.0.1:443`   | externally-reachable host:port advertised to clients  |
| `--octo-url`    | *(required)*      | CDN base URL the client uses for assets (e.g. `http://10.0.2.2:8080`) |
| `--db`          | `db/game.db`      | SQLite database path                                 |
| `--auth-url`    | *(empty)*         | Auth server base URL (e.g. `http://localhost:3000`)  |

### CDN Flags (`octo-cdn`)

| Flag            | Default           | Description                                              |
| --------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--listen`      | `0.0.0.0:8080`    | local bind address                                       |
| `--public-addr` | `127.0.0.1:8080`  | externally-reachable address (used in list.bin rewriting) |
| `--assets-dir`  | `.`               | root directory containing the `assets/` tree             |

### Docker

Three services are available via Docker Compose: the game server (`lunar-tear`), the CDN (`octo-cdn`), and the auth server (`auth-server`). Migrations run automatically on game server start.

```bash
cd server
docker compose up -d
```

The `db/` directory is mounted as a volume so both `game.db` and `auth.db` persist across restarts. Make sure `assets/` is populated before starting.

Each service has its own image and can be deployed independently:

| Service  | Image                       | Default Port | Notes                          |
| -------- | --------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `server` | `kretts/lunar-tear:latest`  | 8003         | gRPC game server               |
| `cdn`    | `kretts/octo-cdn:latest`    | 8080         | HTTP asset CDN                 |
| `auth`   | `kretts/auth-server:latest` | 3000         | Account registration and login |

The game server is configured via environment variables in the compose file: `LUNAR_LISTEN` (bind address), `LUNAR_PUBLIC_ADDR` (client-facing address), `LUNAR_OCTO_URL`, and `LUNAR_AUTH_URL`. Auth is optional — if `LUNAR_AUTH_URL` is unset the game server starts without it.

### Makefile Targets

All targets run from the `server/` directory.

| Target         | Description                                             |

| `make import`  | Import a snapshot (`SNAPSHOT=... UUID=...` required)     |

## Claim Account

Transfers an existing game account to the most recently connected client. Looks up a player by their in-game name, assigns the new client's UUID to that account, and deletes the empty account the new client created.

Useful when a new client connects and creates a throwaway account, but you want it to load an existing account instead.

```bash
cd server
go run ./cmd/claim-account --name "PlayerName" --db db/game.db
```

| Flag     | Default      | Description                                          |
| -------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `--name` | *(required)* | In-game player name to claim                         |
| `--db`   | `db/game.db` | SQLite database path                                 |

## Auth Server

A separate HTTP server that handles player account registration and login. The patched client's Facebook login button is redirected to this server, which presents a username/password form. Tokens issued here are validated by the game server to link or recover accounts.

### Run

```bash
cd server
go run ./cmd/auth-server \
  --listen 0.0.0.0:3000 \
  --db db/auth.db
```

The `--secret` flag accepts a hex-encoded HMAC key. If omitted, a random key is generated on startup and printed to the console — pass it back on the next restart to keep existing tokens valid.

### Flags

| Flag       | Default         | Description                                  |
| ---------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `--listen` | `0.0.0.0:3000`  | HTTP listen address (host:port)              |
| `--db`     | `db/auth.db`    | SQLite database path for auth users          |
| `--secret` | *(generated)*   | Hex-encoded HMAC secret for token signing    |
